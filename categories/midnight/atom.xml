    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>04:28 I was awake since 03:00, as always I was thinking right after I was awake, do I have headache now?, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>But like now when I am in front of my terminal, I have a slightly headache, I am thinking, it&rsquo;s my closed nose. Nothing to be worried about.</p>

<p>Then after an hour trying to sleep, I failed miserably.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s friday, will be a sort of hectic day, still going to bake a cake for &ldquo;Kindi b√∂rse&rdquo; for tomorrow.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just the result of tugging my little darling in bed early &ndash; result of this insomnia or full-stuffed head.</p>

<p>Yeah, they will ask me, why are you too worried? you have healthy kids (which is true, and I am so thankful for) and loving husband..</p>

<p>When I am asked like this, I wish they knew how to be in my shoes. Good night/morning.</p>
