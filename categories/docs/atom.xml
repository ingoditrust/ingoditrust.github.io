    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, another Doc&rsquo;s appointment is done, though I doubt if I had to make it.</p>

<p>I am so glad that today I felt really well, slightly headache but not bad, but still wondered what it was yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, my feet hurt like crazy, and both of them, and I felt something weird inside my chest. Can be heart failure sign, but my God, how pathetic I feel now, but it was something wrong, I felt VERY tired right in the morning immediately after I woke up, which was weird.</p>

<p>I got enought sleep, but weird both feet ache, and weird feeling in my heart or chest.</p>

<p>Before calling the doc, I thought, &ldquo;will he believe what I will say or share to him what I am feeling or have been feeling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because the doc will be my new &ldquo;HausArzt&rdquo; and I was in doubt if this doc will actually listen.</p>

<p>I need someone who can &ldquo;listen&rdquo; to me.</p>

<p>So appointment will be on March 10th.</p>

<p>Oh I went to shop, which is now a great stuff to do with this condition :(</p>
