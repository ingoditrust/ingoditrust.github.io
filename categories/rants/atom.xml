    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think I&rsquo;ve never felt THAT tired today, I was questioning myself, what have I done?</p>

<p>I just baked one cake yesterday, and I am dead tired today, couldn&rsquo;t even pick the cake&rsquo;s plate up from Kindergarten kitchen.</p>

<p>It was once happened, I felt so tired but I forced myself to shop as I thought, I wasn&rsquo;t going to die just because I feel tired.</p>

<p>But in the shop, I felt like I would fall. If I don&rsquo;t have kids I would risk it. But my young kids need me, so I follow what my body says today, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t believe that I am feeling so very tired just because baking ONE cake. Not normal afterall.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My Phsychotherapist once told me, when I comb my hair, I should pull my hair out gently, and I do it too.</p>

<p>However, I sometimes feel like I have ants on my head, and it feels scratchy.</p>

<p>I often look myself at the mirror and focusing on my head skin if there is a blood shed or something like that because I scratched them often. But it didn&rsquo;t then what it is?</p>

<p>I want to know what I am fighting..but it aint easy when you&rsquo;re alone..</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Couldn&rsquo;t help it this morning, took Tomapirin and it helped. Baked the cake, finished it as I have to bring it there tomorrow morning, and felt the headache.</p>

<p>Attempted to take another Tomapirin, but thank God, it was gone all of sudden.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel it right now, but I have the Radiologie CD result from the doc.</p>

<p>Still hoping it won&rsquo;t be something to worry about.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
