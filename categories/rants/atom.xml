    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello best friend, ironic ain&rsquo;t it? I called a site as best friend, but that&rsquo;s what I feel. I can&rsquo;t share if I am not feeling fine with my family in Indo, otherwise they will be very worried, but if I share stuff with my family here they don&rsquo;t believe me.</p>

<p>Now what hurts most is, when you tell someone you are not feeling fine, they&rsquo;d say, it&rsquo;s only on your head.</p>

<p>I try to believe that they are right, so live my days as they go. Bye.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yeah two days ago, it was 18-23°c here in Germany, it was spring!</p>

<p>But since yesterday, the temperature dropped dramatically until 5°.</p>

<p>I got headache again :&ndash;( Though it was gone after I took Tomapiring but it is the same headache, the same location..</p>

<p>Plus I felt strange in my chest, sooooo tired feeling again..</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s temporary..</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong with me, I feel so tired in the afternoon, after doing literally nothing.</p>

<p>Morning, taking my little darling to Kindergarten, go home, cleaning the house a bit not the hard tasks, pick her up again, prepare lunch, eat our lunch, clean the dishes, and now hardly can do anything because of tired feeling.</p>

<p>I want to check, but will they believe me? It was a Brain Tumor suspicion and now Heart disease suspicion, they&rsquo;ll think I am crazy, making it up.</p>

<p>But no, I don&rsquo;t, I feel there is something wrong with me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I got two worst headache two or three days ago, I didn&rsquo;t even feel something on my head in the last two days, it was a bliss.</p>

<p>However, today, I felt slightly terrible headache for a few seconds infront of computer.</p>

<p>I did neck-gym 20 times, seems to be better, but I don&rsquo;t want to have this kind of headache again, please not this one..</p>
