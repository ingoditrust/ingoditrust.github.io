    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong with me, I feel so tired in the afternoon, after doing literally nothing.</p>

<p>Morning, taking my little darling to Kindergarten, go home, cleaning the house a bit not the hard tasks, pick her up again, prepare lunch, eat our lunch, clean the dishes, and now hardly can do anything because of tired feeling.</p>

<p>I want to check, but will they believe me? It was a Brain Tumor suspicion and now Heart disease suspicion, they&rsquo;ll think I am crazy, making it up.</p>

<p>But no, I don&rsquo;t, I feel there is something wrong with me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I got two worst headache two or three days ago, I didn&rsquo;t even feel something on my head in the last two days, it was a bliss.</p>

<p>However, today, I felt slightly terrible headache for a few seconds infront of computer.</p>

<p>I did neck-gym 20 times, seems to be better, but I don&rsquo;t want to have this kind of headache again, please not this one..</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This two worst headaches that happened yesterday, I noticed it always came after meals. The first one came right after lunch, I was even still on my dinning chair.</p>

<p>The second one happened right after my dinner.</p>

<p>Sounds hard to believe but this headache is the one that happened in summer last year, when I called my mom in law to come over.</p>

<p>God, I hope it won&rsquo;t come again&hellip;</p>

<p>It sounds crazy, but I told my husband to sue my first doc if it is a BT.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While I am having lunch today, I have worst headache ever, it was like 5-6 seconds on my forehead, but when it happened, It hurt so much that I would fall down on my chair.</p>

<p>I hope it would be the last time, because I&rsquo;ve been well and happy in the last days.</p>
