    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is a little bit cold, it can be the snow that we had yesterday, more and less 5 degrees.</p>

<p>Strange enough, because it&rsquo;s colder today, I don&rsquo;t have strange feeling on my chest or heart, but I do have terrible headache right after I picked my little darling from Kindergarten.</p>

<p>So bad that I took another Tomapirin and thanks God, it is now gone.</p>

<p>But I really wonder when does thing like this end in my life?</p>

<p>Anyway, here is the pic I took from a hill behind our garden, it was beautiful and make me smile seeing this scenery.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning, like yesterday, I got my feet hurt like crazy, and feeling weird while making my own breakfast, felt like I would pass out, but I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>When I went to Kindi with my little darling, talked with another mom, she said, she feels the same, unwell, and want to pass out.</p>

<p>It could be the weather, which seems really crazy at the moment, yesterday was so warm, today is a little bit cold, etc.</p>

<p>Sigh, I wasn&rsquo;t like this, also the age huh..</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, another Doc&rsquo;s appointment is done, though I doubt if I had to make it.</p>

<p>I am so glad that today I felt really well, slightly headache but not bad, but still wondered what it was yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, my feet hurt like crazy, and both of them, and I felt something weird inside my chest. Can be heart failure sign, but my God, how pathetic I feel now, but it was something wrong, I felt VERY tired right in the morning immediately after I woke up, which was weird.</p>

<p>I got enought sleep, but weird both feet ache, and weird feeling in my heart or chest.</p>

<p>Before calling the doc, I thought, &ldquo;will he believe what I will say or share to him what I am feeling or have been feeling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because the doc will be my new &ldquo;HausArzt&rdquo; and I was in doubt if this doc will actually listen.</p>

<p>I need someone who can &ldquo;listen&rdquo; to me.</p>

<p>So appointment will be on March 10th.</p>

<p>Oh I went to shop, which is now a great stuff to do with this condition :(</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think I&rsquo;ve never felt THAT tired today, I was questioning myself, what have I done?</p>

<p>I just baked one cake yesterday, and I am dead tired today, couldn&rsquo;t even pick the cake&rsquo;s plate up from Kindergarten kitchen.</p>

<p>It was once happened, I felt so tired but I forced myself to shop as I thought, I wasn&rsquo;t going to die just because I feel tired.</p>

<p>But in the shop, I felt like I would fall. If I don&rsquo;t have kids I would risk it. But my young kids need me, so I follow what my body says today, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t believe that I am feeling so very tired just because baking ONE cake. Not normal afterall.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My Phsychotherapist once told me, when I comb my hair, I should pull my hair out gently, and I do it too.</p>

<p>However, I sometimes feel like I have ants on my head, and it feels scratchy.</p>

<p>I often look myself at the mirror and focusing on my head skin if there is a blood shed or something like that because I scratched them often. But it didn&rsquo;t then what it is?</p>

<p>I want to know what I am fighting..but it aint easy when you&rsquo;re alone..</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Couldn&rsquo;t help it this morning, took Tomapirin and it helped. Baked the cake, finished it as I have to bring it there tomorrow morning, and felt the headache.</p>

<p>Attempted to take another Tomapirin, but thank God, it was gone all of sudden.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel it right now, but I have the Radiologie CD result from the doc.</p>

<p>Still hoping it won&rsquo;t be something to worry about.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>04:28 I was awake since 03:00, as always I was thinking right after I was awake, do I have headache now?, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>But like now when I am in front of my terminal, I have a slightly headache, I am thinking, it&rsquo;s my closed nose. Nothing to be worried about.</p>

<p>Then after an hour trying to sleep, I failed miserably.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s friday, will be a sort of hectic day, still going to bake a cake for &ldquo;Kindi b√∂rse&rdquo; for tomorrow.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just the result of tugging my little darling in bed early &ndash; result of this insomnia or full-stuffed head.</p>

<p>Yeah, they will ask me, why are you too worried? you have healthy kids (which is true, and I am so thankful for) and loving husband..</p>

<p>When I am asked like this, I wish they knew how to be in my shoes. Good night/morning.</p>
